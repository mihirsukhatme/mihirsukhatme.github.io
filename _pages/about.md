Hi, I'm Mihir, a 1st year PhD student in the Computational and Systems Biology (CSB) program at MIT! Previously, I attended UCLA where I graduated with a B.S. in Computational and Systems Biology and was supervised by [Dr. Paivi Pajukanta](https://pajukantalab.dgsom.ucla.edu/).

My Research
======
I'm currently interested in exploring the genetic basis of disease, specifically neuro-related traits like alcohol/opioid abuse, Alzheimer's Disease, and Huntington's Disease, through integration of genetic and epigenetic omics data. In the past, I worked with single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing data, as well as built polygenic risk scores (PRS) to quantify variant and population level risk for cardiometabolic traits. I am eager to pursue further studies within this realm, as well as explore the effects of genetic variation between ancestral populations on these outcomes.

Outside of the Lab
======
If I'm not in lab you can find me playing video games, listening to/broadcasting music, or playing sports! Feel free to message me through email to get in touch!
