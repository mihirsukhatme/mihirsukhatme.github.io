Hi! I'm Mihir, a fourth year undergraduate at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)! I just completed my B.S. in Computational and Systems Biology and will be attending MIT as a PhD student in Computational and Systems Biology in Fall 2025! I am currently supervised by [Dr. Paivi Pajukanta](https://pajukantalab.dgsom.ucla.edu/).

My Research
======
I'm currently interested in exploring the basis of disease, specifically obesity and other cardiometabolic traits, through integration of genetic and epigenetic omics data. Specifically, I have worked with single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing data, as well as built polygenic risk scores (PRS) to quantify genetic/variant level risk for cardiometabolic traits. I am eager to pursue further studies within this realm, as well as explore the effects of genetic variation between populations on disease.

My Interests
======
1. Genetic variation
1. Risk associations for disease
1. Sports/Gym
1. Exploring new music genres 
1. Travel
