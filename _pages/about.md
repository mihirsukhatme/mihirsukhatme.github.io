Hi! I'm Mihir, a fourth year undergraduate at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I am currently working towards obtaining my B.S. in Computational and Systems Biology and intend on attending graduate school in Genetics/Genomics as a PhD student in Fall 2025. I am currently supervised by [Dr. Paivi Pajukanta](https://pajukantalab.dgsom.ucla.edu/)

My Research
======
I'm currently interested in exploring the basis of disease, specifically obesity and other cardiometabolic traits, through integration of genetic and epigenetic omics data. Specifically, I have worked with single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing data, as well as built polygenic risk scores (PRS) to quantifty genetic/variant level risk for cardiometabolic traits.

My Interests
======
1. Genetic variation
1. Risk associations for disease
1. Video Games
1. Sports/Gym
1. Exploring new music genres 
1. Travel
