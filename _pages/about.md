Hi, I'm Mihir, a 1st year PhD student in Computational and Systems Biology (CSB) at MIT! Previosuly I attended UCLA where I graduated with a B.S. in Computational and Systems Biology where I was supervised by [Dr. Paivi Pajukanta](https://pajukantalab.dgsom.ucla.edu/).

My Research
======
I'm currently interested in exploring the genetic basis of disease, specifically neuro-related traits like alcohol/opioid abuse, Alzheimer's Disease, and Huntington's Disease, through integration of genetic and epigenetic omics data. In the past, I worked with single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing data, as well as built polygenic risk scores (PRS) to quantify variant and population level risk for cardiometabolic traits. I am eager to pursue further studies within this realm, as well as explore the effects of genetic variation between ancestral populations on these outcomes.

My Interests
======
1. Genetic variation
1. Risk associations for disease
1. Sports/Gym
1. Exploring new music genres 
1. Travel
